# ðŸ§ª Testing Your Build Files Before Hostinger Upload

## Why Test Locally First?

Before uploading to Hostinger, you should verify:
- âœ… All pages load correctly
- âœ… Images and styling work properly
- âœ… Navigation between pages functions
- âœ… Contact forms display correctly
- âœ… Mobile responsive design works
- âœ… No broken links or missing files

## Method 1: Simple Python Server (Recommended)

### Step 1: Navigate to Build Folder
```bash
cd dist/public
```

### Step 2: Start Local Server
```bash
# Python 3 (most common)
python3 -m http.server 8080

# Alternative: Python 2
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

# Alternative: Node.js
npx serve . -p 8080
```

### Step 3: Test Your Website
1. Open browser and go to: **http://localhost:8080**
2. Your Powerton Engineering website should load
3. Test all pages: About, Services, Projects, Contact
4. Test on mobile view (browser developer tools)

## Method 2: Node.js Serve Package

### Install Serve Package
```bash
npm install -g serve
```

### Run Local Server
```bash
serve dist/public -p 8080
```

### Access Website
Visit: **http://localhost:8080**

## Method 3: Double-Click HTML File (Limited)

### Simple Test
1. Navigate to `dist/public` folder
2. Double-click `index.html`
3. Opens in browser but may have limitations

**Note**: This method won't work properly for single-page applications with routing.

## Checking for Errors

### Browser Developer Tools
1. Press **F12** to open developer tools
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for red error messages
4. Refresh page and check for errors

### Common Issues to Fix
- **404 errors**: Missing files or broken links
- **CORS errors**: Cross-origin resource issues
- **Image errors**: Missing or incorrect image paths
- **CSS errors**: Styling not loading properly

## Testing Mobile Responsiveness

### Browser Method
1. Press **F12** (developer tools)
2. Click **device toolbar** icon (phone/tablet icon)
3. Select different device sizes:
   - iPhone (375px width)
   - iPad (768px width)  
   - Desktop (1200px+ width)
4. Test navigation and layout on each size

## File Structure Check

Your `dist/public` folder should contain:
```
dist/public/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          (4.7 KB)
â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-[hash].css    (124 KB - all styles)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index-[hash].js     (771 KB - all JavaScript)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ [images and fonts]
```

## Performance Expectations

Your build is optimized:
- **Total size**: ~900 KB (excellent for business website)
- **Load time**: Under 3 seconds on average internet
- **Mobile performance**: Fast and responsive
- **SEO ready**: Search engine optimized

## If You Find Issues

### Missing Images
- Check image paths in your source code
- Rebuild with: `npm run build`

### Broken Navigation
- Verify all route paths are correct
- Check for case-sensitive file names

### Styling Issues
- Ensure all CSS files are in assets folder
- Check for missing font files

### JavaScript Errors
- Look at browser console for specific errors
- May need to fix source code and rebuild
