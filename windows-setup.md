# Fixed Windows Setup Instructions

## Issues Fixed:
✅ Server binding changed from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost` (Windows compatible)
✅ Converted all .jsx files to .tsx to fix build errors
✅ Added cross-env package for Windows environment variables

## Simple Windows Instructions:

### Method 1: Use the Windows Batch File
```cmd
start-windows.bat
```

### Method 2: Manual Commands
```cmd
set NODE_ENV=development
npx tsx server/index.ts
```

### Method 3: Cross-Platform (Recommended)
```cmd
npx cross-env NODE_ENV=development tsx server/index.ts
```

## What Should Happen:
```
serving on port 5000
```

Then open: **http://localhost:5000**

## Alternative if Still Having Issues:
```cmd
# Skip development mode entirely
npx tsx server/index.ts
```

The main fixes:
1. Changed server host from `0.0.0.0` to `localhost` for Windows compatibility
2. Converted all JSX files to TSX to fix TypeScript compilation errors
3. Added cross-env for proper environment variable handling on Windows

Try running the `start-windows.bat` file I created - it should work now!
