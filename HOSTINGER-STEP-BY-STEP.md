## STEP 1: Prepare Contact Forms (5 minutes)

Your website has contact forms that need to send emails. We'll use Formspree (free service) to handle this.

### 1A: Create Formspree Account
1. Go to **https://formspree.io**
2. Click "Get Started" 
3. Sign up with your email
4. Free plan gives you 50 form submissions per month

### 1B: Create Your Forms
1. In Formspree dashboard, click **"New Form"**
2. Create **two forms**:
   - **Form 1**: Name it "Contact Form" 
   - **Form 2**: Name it "Quote Requests"
3. Copy the form IDs (they look like `xpzkgqjr`)

### 1C: Update Form IDs in Your Code
You'll get two form IDs like this:
- Contact Form ID: `xpzkgqjr`
- Quote Form ID: `xblrdwqm`

**Important**: We'll update these in your code after building.

## STEP 2: Build Your Website (2 minutes)

### 2A: Build the Static Files
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/public` folder with your complete website.

### 2B: What Gets Created
- `dist/public/index.html` - Your homepage
- `dist/public/assets/` - All CSS, JavaScript, images
- `dist/public/about/index.html` - About page
- `dist/public/services/index.html` - Services page
- And all other pages...

4. Navigate to **`public_html`** folder

### 3B: Clear Old Files (if any)
1. Select all files in `public_html`
2. Delete them (or move to backup folder)
3. `public_html` should be empty

### 3C: Upload Your Website
1. Click **"Upload"** in File Manager
2. Select **all files** from your `dist/public` folder
3. Upload everything
4. Wait for upload to complete

**Alternative**: Use FTP client like FileZilla if you prefer.
